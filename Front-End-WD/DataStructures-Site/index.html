            <p>Welcome to my data structure guide</p>
            <p>The following is a list of common data structures along with explanations</p>

        <h3>Arrays</h3>
        <pre>
            +----+----+----+----+----+
            | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | 50 |
            +----+----+----+----+----+
               0    1    2    3    4 
        </pre>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>This is an array data structure.</p>
        <p>It is a an ordered collection of what are called elements</p>
        <p>An element is any value of a certain type, such as number, boolean, even another array</p>
        <p>In the example above the elements are the numbers in the boxes</p>
        <p>Each box represents a place in the array that contains a stored element</p>
        <p>At the bottom of the image you'll see it's labeled with a number</p>
        <p>These numbers are called indices, the index represents the position of the element in the array</p>
        <p>As mentioned, Arrays are ordered starting from index 0, and elements are next to each other</p>
        <h4>Code Examples Javascript</h4>
        <p>let numberList = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]</p>
        <p>This is how you would make the above array</p>
        <p>let firstNumber = numberList[0]</p>
        <p>This is called index notation you can access elements in the array using it's index</p>

            <h3>Linked List</h3>
            <pre>
                +----+    +----+    +----+    +----+    +----+
                        | 10 | -> | 20 | -> | 30 | -> | 40 | -> | 50 | -> NULL
                +----+    +----+    +----+    +----+    +----+
            </pre>
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This is a Linked List data structure.</p>
            <p>Linked List consist of Nodes, each node has a velue, which is the number in the box</p>
            <p>Unlike arrays they are not stored next to each other in memory but has a pointer which</p>
            <p>is represented by the arrows between the boxes, the pointer is the address of the next value in the list</p>
            <p></p>
            <p></p>

            <h3>Stack</h3>
            <pre>
                +----+
                | 50 |
                +----+
                | 40 |
                +----+
                | 30 |
                +----+
                | 20 |
                +----+
                | 10 |
                +----+
            </pre>
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This is a Stack data structure.</p>
