        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>This is an array data structure.</p>
        <p>It is a an ordered collection of what are called elements</p>
        <p>An element is any value of a certain type, such as number, boolean, even another array</p>
        <p>In the example above the elements are the numbers in the boxes</p>
        <p>Each box represents a place in the array that contains a stored element</p>
        <p>At the bottom of the image you'll see it's labeled with a number</p>
        <p>These numbers are called indices, the index represents the position of the element in the array</p>
        <p>As mentioned, Arrays are ordered starting from index 0, and elements are next to each other</p>
        <h4>Code Examples Javascript</h4>
        <p>let numberList = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]</p>
        <p>This is how you would make the above array</p>
        <p>let firstNumber = numberList[0]</p>
        <p>This is called index notation you can access elements in the array using it's index</p>
