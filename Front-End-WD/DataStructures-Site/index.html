        <h4>Overview:</h4>
        <p>This is an array data structure.</p>
        <p>It is a an ordered collection of what are called elements</p>
        <p>An element is any value of a certain type, such as number, boolean, even another array</p>
        <p>In the example above the elements are the numbers in the boxes</p>
        <p>Each box represents a place in the array that contains a stored element</p>
        <p>At the bottom of the image you'll see it's labeled with a number</p>
        <p>These numbers are called indices, the index represents the position of the element in the array</p>
        <p>As mentioned, Arrays are ordered from index 0 to the last index</p>
